### This is where I begin my data journey.

The past 12 weeks was 'killer' intense. From stats, to econometrics. From machine learning to neural networks.
I've dealt with data before, but never this way!
Having come from an e-commerce background of 5+ years, I've always had a knack for data. The GA Data Science Immersive course took that and made it into a passion. Being equipped and having the right skills that are industry applicable has brought data science to my career forefront!
I am excited and I hope to be part of a larger data journey in the industry.
